# Quest_List
Developed a quest list using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
This project is based off of Tyler Potts' video on building a Todo List app. 
The goal of this project is to create a personalized website that has my very own to-do list that I can add, edit, and delete items from. 
This is the first phase, the items on this list do not persist after the page is refreshed.
The next phase is making it so that my to-do list doesn't disappear upon a refresh.
